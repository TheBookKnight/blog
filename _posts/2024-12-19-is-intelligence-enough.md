On my Uber ride to the airport, my Uber driver (let's call him "The Driver") revealed that he no longer has Christmas plans. His girlfriend left him. For five months, they've been together until she cut off communication from him. He was left puzzled.

I don't know him too well. But, from our 20 min drive, the Driver seemed to be a respectable person. Although 59 years old, he was a former CFO who invested his retirement time in taking care of his father and pleasurable hobbies like being a tour guide. He had an average build and height as well as being a great conversationalist.

This wasn't his first long term relationship either. Previously, the Driver had a wife for 19 years. However, she started "exploring around." He tried to salvage his marriage but to no avail.

Although he had a sour taste of the dating market, he was undeterred to find the right woman. As in a matter of fact, he's in the chat with another woman. Though, I've doubts because she was a former business executive -- another _captain_.

> If a woman chooses to be her own captain, and parks her boat with the other captains, she'll be competing for the attention for the other male passengers. If a man devotes their life building their own boats, he will never walk away from their vessel to be a passenger of a woman's boat. ~ [Dr Orion Taraban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVyYHonNriw)

So, this got me curious. What does it take to get a successful relationship? Being good isn't good enough. You still get smarted even when you're smart.

Like the Driver, I've friends who make a decent living and are younger. One is an architect. Another is an accountant. But, they only have broken relationships to the point that they're questioning their vocation.

I'll sound elitist when I say this. I've friends who are "average Joes" yet have better success in dating and marrying women more than my friends or I.

Granted, I don't know the full picture. But, that's the point. How will I see the bigger picture? I'll sound like a dork for saying this, I've tried studying to find the right woman. But, I never had a girlfriend.

Perhaps, I am getting closer to finding the right woman but I'm just not seeing this. It feels like one of those chess games where you are in a complex, seemingly-compromised position. But, you actually have the advantage.

This past decade, I followed Scott Adam's advice for "systems over goals." I sacrificed social activities in exchange for growing my tech skill stack. Now, I've a six-figure salary. I've developed connections in Catholic young adult groups. Now, I've people to keep me (or at least try) morally and spiritually rooted. Related to the latter, I moved to Florida. Every day, I've an opportunity to talk to another young adult woman. Currently, I've invested countless hours watching Youtube or reading books on relationships ranging from PUA to Catholic priests giving advice. Although I'm a shy introvert, I occassionally find opportunities to chat up with a young lady.

> A goal is a specific objective that you either achieve or don't sometime in the future. A system is something you do on a regular basis that increases your odds of happiness in the long run. If you do something every day, its a system. ~ [Scott Adams](https://www.amazon.com/How-Fail-Almost-Everything-Still/dp/1591847745)

Or maybe, this "knowledge" is an illusion. And instead, I've somehow created a filter that hides good women and leaves only wolves in sheeps clothing.

Reflecting back, I also did date more women these past few years than compared to my college life and prior. It's just frustrating when every month, someone you know is getting married. Perhaps, I'm still learning. And the final lesson is me accepting that knowledge doesn't change anything. It's only in God's time.
