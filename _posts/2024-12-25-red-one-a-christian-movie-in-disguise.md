This past decade, the film industry produced tons of movies with rehashed sequels and the same, bland formula: Looney Toon action, cheeky humor, and one-dimensional characters. The Christmas movies were no different, devoid of Christ.

From the trailer, _the Red One_ might appear the same. But stepping back, it may have whispered the true meaning of Christmas. So, you might ask, what is that?

Christmas is when all Christians **should** celebrate when God became man. Breaking the word down, it's "Mass on Christ's Day." He was born as Jesus Christ to redeem all of humanity, even when undeserved. The movie _the Red One_ served as the allegory.

Santa Claus was portrayed to be an all-good, omniscient force who always has faith in humanity. He had a disciple named Callum Drift, the head of North Pole security. Drift (ironically named) lost his faith in Santa's mission because the grownups live as if decisions of being naughty or nice no longer matter. In response, Santa had a father-to-son conversation which he affirmed the Christian mission - to spread hope even when there seems none.

Callum Drift had a Saint Peter-like return to faith when he had to team up with the black-hat hacker Jack O'Malley to rescue Santa. O'Malley had no moral qualms stealing, even going so far as to taking candy from a baby. He also saw himself unworthy to be a father to his son.

Initially, Drift was disgusted by O'Malley. But then, he listened. He realized that O'Malley are almost the same: lost and cynical about humanity. Then, when O'Malley started to choose to save others over himself, Drift saw the child-like purity in him and believed O'Malley can redeem himself. Re-aligning himself to Santa's philosophy, Drift directly told him so.

I give this movie a 3.5/5. It still has some action and comedy cheese for the kids who joined their parents in watching this movie. But, the themes and great acting from the leads redeemed it. This movie gives hope and accountability to adults or more specifically Christians, especially in a world that seems cloaked by deception and cynicism.
